<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract"> Many medical applications require a registration of different images of the same organ. In many cases, such a registration is accomplished by manually placing landmarks in the images. In this paper we propose a method which is able to find reasonable landmarks automatically. To achieve this, nodes of the vessel systems, which have been extracted from the images by a segmentation algorithm, will be assigned by the so-called association graph method  and the coordinates of these matched nodes can be used as landmarks for a non-rigid registration algorithm.</p>
