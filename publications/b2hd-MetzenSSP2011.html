<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract"> Machine learning approaches are increasingly used in brain-machine-interfaces toallow automatic adaptation to user-specific brainpatterns. One of the most crucial factors for the practical success of thesesystems is that this adaptation can be achieved with a minimum amount oftraining data since training data needs to be recorded during acalibration procedure prior to the actual usage session. To this end, onepromising approach is to reuse models based on data recorded in precedingsessions of the same or of other users. In this paper, we investigateunder which conditions it is favorable to reuse models (more specificallyspatial filters) trained on data from historic sessions compared to learning newspatial filters on the current session's calibration data. We present anempirical study in a scenario in which Brain Reading, a particular kind ofbrain-machine-interface, is used to support robotic telemanipulation.</p>
