<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract"> Life-long learning of reusable, versatile skills is a key prerequisite forembodied agents that act in a complex, dynamic environment and are faced withdifferent tasks over their lifetime.  We address the question of how an agentcan learn useful skills efficiently during a developmental period,i.e., when no task is imposed on him and no external reward signal is provided.Learning of skills in a developmental period needs to be incremental andself-motivated. We propose a new incremental, task-independent skill discoveryapproach that is suited for continuous domains. Furthermore, the agent learnsspecific skills based on intrinsic motivation mechanisms thatdetermine on which skills learning is focused at a given point in time. Weevaluate the approach in a reinforcement learning setup in two continuousdomains with complex dynamics. We show that an intrinsically motivated, skilllearning agent outperforms an agent which learns task solutions from scratch.Furthermore, we compare different intrinsic motivation mechanisms and howefficiently they make use of the agent's developmental period.</p>

	abstract = {Life-long learning of reusable, versatile skills is a key prerequisite for
embodied agents that act in a complex, dynamic environment and are faced with
different tasks over their lifetime.  We address the question of how an agent
can learn useful skills efficiently during a developmental period,
i.e., when no task is imposed on him and no external reward signal is provided.
Learning of skills in a developmental period needs to be incremental and
self-motivated. We propose a new incremental, task-independent skill discovery
approach that is suited for continuous domains. Furthermore, the agent learns
specific skills based on intrinsic motivation mechanisms that
determine on which skills learning is focused at a given point in time. We
evaluate the approach in a reinforcement learning setup in two continuous
domains with complex dynamics. We show that an intrinsically motivated, skill
learning agent outperforms an agent which learns task solutions from scratch.
Furthermore, we compare different intrinsic motivation mechanisms and how
efficiently they make use of the agent's developmental period.},
