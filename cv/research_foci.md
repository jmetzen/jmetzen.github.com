Research Foci
-----------------

Robot Control Learning
:    I am developing and extending methods from the domain of reinforcement learning ([relevant publications](https://jmetzen.github.io/publications/class_rescat.html#Reinforcement%20Learning)) and evolutionary computation ([relevant publications](https://jmetzen.github.io/publications/class_rescat.html#Neuroevolution)) for learning locomotion and manipulation behaviors of mobile robots. In particular, developing methods for decomposing complex problems into simpler subproblems and developing learning algorithms which combine policy search with active and multi-task learning have been foci of my work. I have conducted this work as part of the project [BesMan](http://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/research/projects/besman-1.html).

BCIs
:    My work in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) was focused on using supervised machine learning techniques to detect certain patterns in a human's electroencephalogram #(EEG) that indicate that the human has perceived and recognized important messages that have been presented to him or that he intends to execute a movement shortly. My work in the [VI-Bot](http://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/research/projects/vi-bot.html) and [IMMI](http://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/research/projects/immi.html) projects was focused mainly on developing supervised multi-task learning algorithms that allow detecting these patterns with a minimum amount of labeled training data from the current user by reusing data from historic sessions of the same and other users ([relevant publications](https://jmetzen.github.io/publications/class_rescat.html#Brain%20Computer%20Interface)).

Biomedical Pattern Recognition
:    Identifying patterns in biomedical data has been one focus of my work. Besides the work on BCIs, I have also developed novel graph-based methods for the matching of anatomical trees of liver and lung extracted from medical images recorded using CT and MRI, which allow the registration of several medical images of the same organ that have been recorded using different modalities or at different points in time ([relevant publications](https://jmetzen.github.io/publications/class_rescat.html#Graph%20Matching%20)). More currently, within the project [Cascade](http://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/research/projects/cascade-1.html), we have applied oversegmentation and supervised machine learning approaches to detect aortic calcifications and bifurcations in intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and CT recordings.

Deep Learning
:    Together with colleagues, I am currently developing deep learning methods for detecting objects in RGB images of unstructured environments and for identifying suitable grasp poses for robotic manipulators based on RGB-D data. For this, a set of candidate regions in images which may contain objects is generated based on a heuristic and each of these regions is then classified using a deep neural network into different object categories. Another neural network is used to classify different grasp pose candidates for the detected objects into feasible and not feasible for a robotic gripper.
