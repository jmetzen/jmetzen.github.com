<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract"> Machine learning is increasingly used to autonomously adapt brain-machineinterfaces to user-specific brain patterns. In order tominimize thepreparation time of the system, it is highly desirable to reduce the length ofthe calibration procedure, during which training data is acquired from the user,to a minimum. One recently proposed approach is to reuse models that have beentrained in historic usage sessions of the same or other users by utilizing anensemble-based approach. In this work, we propose two extensions of thisapproach which are based on the idea to combine predictions made bythe historic ensemble with session-specific predictions that become availableonce a small amount of training data has been collected. These extensions areparticularly useful for Brain Reading Interfaces (BRIs), a specific kindof brain-machine interfaces. BRIs do not require that userfeedback is given and thus, additional training data may be acquiredconcurrently to the usage session. Accordingly, BRIs should initiallyperform well when only a small amount of training data acquired in ashort calibration procedure is available and allow an increased performancewhen more training data becomes available during the usage session. Anempirical offline-study in a testbed for the use of BRIs to support robotictelemanipulation shows that the proposed extensions allow to achieve thiskind of behavior.</p>
